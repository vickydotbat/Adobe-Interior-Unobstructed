# Adobe Interior Unobstructed
 An unobstructed version of the Adobe Interior tileset

 
Credits for the original NWN:EE conversion by quevy. The original tileset was, of course, made by Rjshae for NWN2. You can find the NWN:EE version on the vault here: https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwnee/hakpak/tileset/adobe-interior

These files will override the existing Adobe Interior tiles with ones that have less obstructing beams. Some structures needed those beams to be realistic or to not undergo extensive modification, but I've still reduced the amount of visual clutter overall for the entire tileset.

If you see anything amiss, let me know on Discord.

# Installation

Simply clone the Git or download the files and drop them into either your "Neverwinter Nights/development" folder or "Neverwinter Nights/override", your preference. You could also compile them into a patch hak if you wanted.
